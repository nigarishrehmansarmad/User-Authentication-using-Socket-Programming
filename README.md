# User-Authentication-using-Socket-Programming

## Motivation
In today's world, secure communication and authentication systems are essential. This project was initiated to understand, design, and implement a secure socket-based authentication system. It reflects an effort to design a robust, secure architecture using JWT tokens to unify authentication, benefiting both real-time and traditional web interactions.
